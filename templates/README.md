### Templates

Things to keep in mind regarding templates:

- First line is the subject for the mail.
- Mail body and subject __are and must be__ separated by an empty new line.
- Use HTML syntax to format the mail body.
- Update the _variable to column name mapping_ in `variable_mapping.py`, if there is a new variable for a template whose value will be retrieved from the csv file.
