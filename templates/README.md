### Templates

Things to keep in mind regarding templates:

- First line is the subject for the mail.
- Mail body and subject __are and must__ be separated by an empy line.
- The email column must be the 2nd column(if the counting starts from 1), it is fixed because mostly this is how it's gonna be.
- Use HTML syntax to format the mail body.
